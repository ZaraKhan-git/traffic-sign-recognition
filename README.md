# 🚦 Traffic Sign Recognition
This is my Task 2 for the Computer Vision Internship at ARCH Technologies.


## 📊 Summary
Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify 43 different types of traffic signs. Used preprocessed `.pickle` data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-preprocessed).

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Traffic Signs Preprocessed - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-preprocessed)
- Format: Pickle files (`data5.pickle`, etc.)

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- 3 Convolutional Layers
- MaxPooling, Dropout
- Fully Connected Dense Layer
- Output: 43 Softmax Classes

## 🏁 Accuracy

Achieved **96.47%** accuracy on test data.

## 📦 How to Run

Open `traffic_sign_recogition.ipynb` in Google Colab and run all cells.
